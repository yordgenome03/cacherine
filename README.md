`cacherine` is a simple and flexible memory cache library for Dart. It provides basic caching algorithms such as FIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU. Both single-threaded and async-enabled versions are available to handle different usage scenarios.

If you want to choose the best cache algorithm for your app, you can use **MonitoredCache** in your development environment. It helps you monitor performance metrics (such as hit/miss rates, latency, and eviction alerts) so you can make data-driven decisions and optimize the algorithm you use.

## Why cacherine?

Dart/Flutter does not have a built-in caching solution similar to `NSCache` in Swift.  
`cacherine` was created to provide a lightweight and flexible in-memory cache with common caching strategies like FIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU.

Whether you need a simple single-threaded cache or an async-compatible solution for concurrent environments, `cacherine` offers an easy-to-use API.

## Features

- **FIFO** (First In, First Out)
- **EphemeralFIFO** (FIFO-based cache where keys are removed after being accessed)
- **LRU** (Least Recently Used)
- **MRU** (Most Recently Used)
- **LFU** (Least Frequently Used)
- **MonitoredCache** (Includes performance monitoring with hit/miss rates, latency, and eviction alerts) â€” [Learn more](doc/monitored_cache.md)
- **Simple versions (e.g., SimpleFIFOCache) for single-threaded usage, and standard versions for multi-threaded environments**

## Installation

Check the latest version on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cacherine) and add it to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cacherine: ^latest_version
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dart pub get
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage (Single-threaded)

```Dart
import 'package:cacherine/cacherine.dart';

void main() {
  final cache = SimpleFIFOCache<String, String>(maxSize: 5);
  cache.set('key1', 'value1');
  print(cache.get('key1')); // 'value1'
}
```

### Async Usage (Async support)

```Dart
import 'package:cacherine/cacherine.dart';

void main() async {
  final cache = FIFOCache<String, String>(maxSize: 5);
  await cache.set('key1', 'value1');
  print(await cache.get('key1')); // 'value1'
}
```

### Monitoring Usage

If you want to monitor the performance of your cache and optimize the algorithm, use MonitoredCache.
